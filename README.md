# HackUPC 2022

## Inspiration

We talked with the mundimoto tech team and they encouraged us to develop this project.

##What it does

It consists of a recommendation system that makes suggestion about motorcycles based on the user preferences and those clients who are similar to them. It also makes price prediction using machine learning-type techniques.

## How we built it

On the frontend side it uses VueJS and on the backend it uses nodeJS for the majority and also python, mainly to implement the price prediction part.

## Challenges we ran into

The most difficult part was setting up the DBs and making the main configuration as well as agreeing to which programming languages we were going to use.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We're very proud of the whole project but specially of how professional our work looks. Although it has been made in less than 36 hours, we think that the final product works pretty well.
